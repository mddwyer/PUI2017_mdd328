Unisse's maps are very clear, showing the breakdown of waste type collection by community district in New York City. The quantile breaks 
chosen for the color scheme show each range of collected trash percentage while ensuring the same amount of data goes into each category,
showing which neigborhoods  throw away certain types of trash. The colors themselves are well chosen, along with the size and placement
of the legend. Another way to show these map could be smaller and side by side, provoking a more direct comparison between percentages 
rather than scrolling up and down. 

# FBB feedback: the latter is a good point: it would be in the spirit of Tufte's small multiples

For the final graph, the colors are aesthetically nice and the bar graphs show a clear trend. However, the bars within each borough 
are not labelled by year making the graph confusing at first glance. Additionally, there appears to be a blue color in the graph
unaccounted for in the legend that would be helpful in clarifying. 

# FBB you missed that the color choice is not color-blind safe (red and green is a big nono)

Overall, the plots clearly convey a multidimensional and potentially overwhelming dataset. 

# FBB this is however a set of 4 plots, not connected, not a single visualization. if like you suggested they were shown side by side they would be a single viz. but as it is they are a series of 3 maps and a bar plot. Additionally, the 5 bars per plot in the bottm graph are unexplained completely, and the percentages should be percentiles I think : they make no sense as percentages (they add to >> 100%)
