Hongkai's graph shows the relationship between greenhouse gas emission and  energy use intensity, showing a clear positive correlation. 
The colors are well chosen, 

# FBB the color are not color blind compliant

and the scale of the axis seems appropriate for the range of data displayed. The graph could be improved by
the addition of a caption, describing any particular trends or outliers to look out for when interpreting the graph. Additionally, the 
legend could be colored differently or given a border, as at first glance the blue dot that represents observations appears to be a data
point itself. 

# FBB ok: the legend as is may contribute to confusion. however your suggestion of plotting with a different color background woudl likely become distracting especially in a plot that is as sparse as this

# FBB additionally I asked to comment on three axis: esthetic, confusion, honesty. It is not clear that you considered each

Overall, the plot clearly portrays the relationship between EUI and GHG emissions. 

9/10
