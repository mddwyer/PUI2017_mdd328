### Clarity
##### is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous? 

The plot is very clear, segmenting the colors into three categories, good, fair, and poor, makes it easy to interpret and distinguish which part of the plot represents which type of tree. It seems like the trend in the number of trees follows through all three classes of trees, and any peaks in the number of good trees can be seen in both the fair and poor trees. This makes it difficult to actually distinguish how the composition of trees changes at that diameter. I think to make this more clear, the plot could be split into two plots. One plot would show the overall distribution of trees at that diameter. The other would show the normalized proportion of good, fair, and poor trees. That way, the height of the bars would stay the same and would make changes in the proportion of good, fair, and poor trees would be much more visible as a function of tree size. If you don't care about the total number of trees at each diameter, you could also just drop the first plot and only use the normalized plot.

### Aesthetic
##### beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

The color choices are good and represent conventionally used color codes for quality, and using green to indicate healthy trees just makes sense. The legend placement is good, as it is placed in the least crowded area of the plot. A small cosmetic detail, but the X axis extends below zero and I think it would make more sense to have tight axes and not leave unnecessary whitespace. Overall it is a really pleasing to look at graph and the colors are aesthetically pleasing and seem to be taken from the same palette.


### Honesty
##### is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?

The plot gives an honest representation of the data that it says it is showing, but I think clarity would be improved using a normalized plot, as I can't really tell if the plot is saying that there are a higher proportion of trees in poor health at higher diameters. It is something that I would assume, but I can't really discern that from the plot. 

Good job Matt!
