Homework 11 involved using KMeans and Gaussian Mixture clustering on counts of NYC businesses by zip code. A time series graph was also produced to find concentrations of like zip codes with similar numbers of businesses. I worked with Dana, who helped me with whitening the data, Prince, who helped with retrieving and cleaning the data, and Sarah, Emily, and Rebecca. 

Lab 11 involved writing a KMeans function using randomly generated data, and showing each iteration in an animation. I worked with Dana and Sarah on this section.
